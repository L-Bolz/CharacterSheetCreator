A character sheet creator for table top games that can export to PDF

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
In this case you might want to define a .env.local file, e.g.:
```
PORT=8082
```
You should also set the `PORT` to make sure that the localStorage remains the same, even if you restart the server.

Afterwards run the dev server:
```
npm run serve
```

### Build for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
